In mobile app development, Dart is used to write the application code. Its features, such as strong typing and async programming, help developers build robust and responsive apps.
Flutter:

Flutter is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses Dart as its programming language and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets and tools for creating modern and performant UIs.
Flutter manages the layout and rendering of the UI, making it easier to create complex and customized user interfaces.
3. Complementary Roles:

Dart and Flutter complement each other by providing a complete solution for app development. Dart is the language used for writing app logic, while Flutter handles the UI rendering. This integration allows developers to use a single language and framework to build cross-platform applications, ensuring consistency and reducing development time.
4. Importance of Updating the PATH Environment Variable:

Why Update PATH:
The PATH environment variable tells the operating system where to find executable files. By adding Dart and Flutter to PATH, you can run their commands from any terminal or command prompt without specifying the full path to the executables.
Impact on Usage:
Without updating the PATH, you would need to navigate to the Flutter or Dart directory to execute commands. Updating PATH simplifies usage, allowing you to run commands like flutter and dart from any location in your terminal.
5. Verifying Installation of Dart and Flutter:

Command: dart --version

Expected Outcome: Displays the installed Dart version. This confirms that Dart is correctly installed and accessible.
Command: flutter doctor

Expected Outcome: Provides a detailed status report of the Flutter installation, including checks for the Flutter SDK, Dart SDK, connected devices, and dependencies like Android Studio or Xcode. It identifies issues and offers recommendations for fixing them.
6. Purpose of the flutter doctor Command:

Purpose:

The flutter doctor command inspects your development environment and identifies any missing dependencies or configuration issues. It checks for the Flutter SDK, Dart SDK, required platforms (Android, iOS), and other essential tools.
How It Helps:

By running flutter doctor, you receive a summary of your setup status and any necessary actions to complete your development environment. It ensures that all required components are installed and correctly configured, helping to prevent issues during development.
